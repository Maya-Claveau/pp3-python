## **Why This**

<p>This snake quiz was inspired by my 8 year old who has a fascination about snakes, and strange insects. Personally, I was never a big fan of snakes, mainly scared of them. However, in my son’s eyes, they are cute and beautiful. I guess when you look at those pictures, you could say that:</p>

<p>Being an encouraging mom I did try to gather all the information out there to satisfy his curious mind. In the process, I ended up learning a fair amount of interesting facts about the creature. He did ask for a snake as a pet, I couldn't agree with that, but I decided to build this quiz instead. Hoping other people could learn a thing or two about snakes by playing this quiz, to spark interest and dive deep into it, not only about snakes but about nature in general.</p>
