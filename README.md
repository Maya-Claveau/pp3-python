## **Why This**

<p>This snake quiz was inspired by my 8 year old who has a fascination about snakes, and strange insects. Personally, I was never a big fan of snakes, mainly scared of them. However, in my sonâ€™s eyes, they are cute and beautiful. I guess when you look at those pictures, you could say that:</p>

<p>Being an encouraging mom I did try to gather all the information out there to satisfy his curious mind. In the process, I ended up learning a fair amount of interesting facts about the creature. He did ask for a snake as a pet, I couldn't agree with that, but I decided to build this quiz instead. Hoping other people could learn a thing or two about snakes by playing this quiz, to spark interest and dive deep into it, not only about snakes but about nature in general.</p>

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
