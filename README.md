<p>This was built with the intention of entertaining the player, as well as education with some interesting facts. Main objectives are:</p>

- to test the player's knowledge about snakes
- to challenge the players memory 
- to increase the players's interests and curiousity about snakes 
- and most importantly to LOVE NATURE

## **Why This**

<p>This snake quiz was inspired by my 8 year old who has a fascination about snakes, bugs and reptiles. Personally, I was never a big fan of snakes, mainly scared of them. However, in my sonâ€™s eyes, they are cute and beautiful. I guess when you look at those pictures, you could say that:</p>

<p>Being an encouraging mom I did try to gather all the information out there to satisfy his curious mind. In the process, I ended up learning a fair amount of interesting facts about the creature. So I hope with this game, I could influence other people, and spark interest as well, not only about snakes but about nature in general. </p>

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
