## **Why This**

<p>This snake quiz was inspired by my 8 year old who has a fascination about snakes, and strange insects. Personally, I was never a big fan of snakes, mainly scared of them. However, in my son’s eyes, they are cute and beautiful. I guess when you look at those pictures, you could say that:</p>

<p>Being an encouraging mom I did try to gather all the information out there to satisfy his curious mind. In the process, I ended up learning a fair amount of interesting facts about the creature. He did ask for a snake as a pet, I couldn't agree with that, but I decided to build this quiz instead. Hoping other people could learn a thing or two about snakes by playing this quiz, to spark interest and dive deep into it, not only about snakes but about nature in general.</p>

<p>Menu item 3 Restart : you would choose this option when you have already played your 1st game, and would like to play again. By choosing this option, the quiz will start straight away without asking you to input username. That is assuming you will not choose this option if you are playing for the first time.</p>
